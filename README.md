# Random Maze 3D

## General Infromation

This project was created for the ISART Digital school by RÃ©mi Serra. <br>
The end goal was to create a maze using OpenGL 2 and C++, which the player could explore. It had to be textured, lit and could optionally have collisions. <br> 
<br>
The player is positionned at the start of a randomly generated and textured maze. <br> 
They must explore it to find the 5 rooms where chests need to be opened. <br> 
Once all chests have been opened, the exit door will open and the player will be able to exit the maze. <br>
When this happens, collisions are disabled, all of the paths are revealed on the minimap, and a bright light is turned on. <br>

## Build and launch

Use the make command to build the project and start the "maze" executable to launch it (exclusive to Linux).

<br>

## Camera controls

Use `WASD` to move the camera in the world. <br>
`Right click` and move the mouse to rotate the camera. <br>
`Space` and `shift` can be used to move up and down (the player will clip through the ground and ceiling). <br>
Use the `R` and `F` keys to toggle the minimap. <br>
Use the `1` and `2` keys to toggle wireframe view. <br>
Use the `3` and `4` keys to switch between perspective and orthographic views. <br>
Use the `5` and `6` keys to toggle a bright ambient light. <br>
Use the `7` and `8` keys to toggle the player's point light. <br>
Use the `9` and `0` keys to toggle collisions with the maze. <br>
Use the numpad numbers and decimal point to test the rendering of basic shapes. <br>
(for some reason GL_COLOR_MATERIAL makes the lights brighter, and the only fix is to restart the program)
